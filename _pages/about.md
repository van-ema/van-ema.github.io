Hi, I'm Emanuele. 

I'm a software engineer and I live in Amsterdam (NL).

My life is multitasking: I code, boxe, run, cook (of course, I'm italian you know), and sometimes I raise a kernel panick.

Besides other things I like **cybersecurity**. Down here you'll fine some academic papers I worked on.
Currently, I'm looking into **Rust** and *fuzzing*. I brought up this blog mostly to organize my thoughts and work.


<!-- Here you'll find posts spanning from random thoughts to more technical stuff. I won't add more, let my posts speak for themselves. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
