Welcome at [emavan.com](emavan.com). \
I'm a software engineer based in Amsterdam. I'm passionate about software and hardware security. 

Currently, I'm working on Rust and memory safety projects during my free time.\
I may use this site to dump any kind of note which reckon worth to share.\
*Use them at your own risk!*

Do you want to connect? You can find me on [linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/emanuele-vannacci).



<!-- Here you'll find posts spanning from random thoughts to more technical stuff. I won't add more, let my posts speak for themselves. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
